          Classroom Training- Learners are initially being trained in the
          classroom (physical or virtual). They are focused on different modules
          through live lectures, assessments, hands-on tasks, etc. In Pvt
          Techvanto. During the whole training process through our Success
          Board, we closely watch the progress of the learner. We monitor the
          success by measuring their participation in the programme (Live +
          Recording) and their results in Quizzes, Tests, assignments and
          projects. A 60 per cent score in the programme, which will apply for
          placement education and career services, will be expected for
          applicants.
          <br />
          A learner must recognise that a good placement cannot exist if they
          have not centred their research on the subject matter. The reasoning
          behind the eligibility requirements The current ranking for placement
          interactions is lowered by 50% in our programme. If not, it will be a
          pointless attempt to partake in interviews when we have had many
          examples of rejections back to back without an invitation for students
          of fewer than 50 per cent. These students had to take revision classes
          to be placed. This takes more time and resources, which is why we all
          assist our students in reaching 50 per cent in their first attempt. We
          also make 3 assessments for all examinations and then take into
          account the highest marks (out of 3) for assessment. Also, students
          who do not achieve the 50% criterion will be granted additional
          cost-free) opportunities to boost their score and be considered for
          the placement process. Following the training, we will arrange 2
          interviews for the students.
          <br />
          We strive as a strategy to provide freshers with at least three lakhs.
          But requirements on the market could include a 3-6 months initial
          internship and then get the final package (currently not for
          newbies/learners/freshers who have graduated without a job). Often a
          job transition may occur with the same kit in cases of working
          professionals
          <br />
          During the placements process, the Techvanto team will be 100% open
          concerning business dynamics and the applicant fitting for the
          employer JD. Learners should be agile in selecting the right choices
          during their degrees and in making their career aspirations progress.
